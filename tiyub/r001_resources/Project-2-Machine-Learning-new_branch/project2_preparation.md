# Project 2: Application of Machine Learning in Predicting Stock Direction

## Context
Predicting the direction of the stock has been always a strong interest of every trader because once we anticipate a trend we can make a profit via "buy low and sell high". However it's not an easy task. Stock market is subject to quick changes, random fluctuation, non linear, and non symentric mainly because participants are irrational, emotional, and implusive in their trading behavior . However complex the market is, there is a belief that given mass trading behaviors repetitive patterns exist, which is a foundation of technical analysis.

In this project via applying different types of machine learning models, we would like to examine (1) if selective technical indicators could predict the stock direction with statistically significant level  (2) which model is the best (3) Whether we could optimize the model (4) Which time frame the model could generate the best result. 

Selective technical indicators include (using FINTA Library)
* Bollinger Bands (2 sd?)
* Simple Moving Average Crossover( which window? long- short)
* RSI
* Fibonacci Pivot Points
* On Balance Volume 
* ...

Machine Learning Model (TBD)
* Logistic Regression
* Support Vector Machine
* Deep Learning
* Ensemble Methods
* Decision Tree Random Forest
* ..... 

Predicted Time Frame (TBD)
* 3 days
* 5 days (1 trading weeks)
* 7 days

Chosen stocks
* AAPL
* ...
* ...

<b> <u> @ TEAM: ACTION NEEDED </u> </b>: each of us will choose one models

## Purpose
By applying machine learning models, we examine (1) if selective technical indicators could predict the stock direction with statistically significant level (2) Which model is the best (3) Whether we could optimize the model (4) Which time frame the model could generate the best result. 

Objective: lowest loss, highest accurarcy


## The Settings

* Time horizon: 5 years - 1/1/2017 - 12/31/2021
* ..

## Steps

Step 1: Gather data

Step 2: Data preparation and preprocessing
* Implement explanatory data analysis (EDA)
* Calculate data
* Define features and labels
* Encode
* Divide data into training - test 

Step 3: Choose model and apply the model

Step 4: Training the model 

Step 5: Predict - Evaluation - Model Tuning to reach lowest loss, highest accuracy

Step 6: Consolidate results and choose the best model

Step 7: Run the model for different time frames and stocks ( make it go live for production)

Step 8: Presentation  and Markdownfile preparation 


## Proposed Timeline

<b> <u> @ TEAM: ACTION NEEDED </u> </b> : if this timeline is ok for you?

With the objectives of :
* collaborating efficiently among team
* each of us having a chance to practise what we have studied and learnt
* making the best use of time in class

## Several notes to make it productable

* http://cta.irap.omp.eu/ctools/develop/coding/python.html
* Using def as much as you could


## Additional things we could if we have time 

* Create a bot
* Backtest the best model
